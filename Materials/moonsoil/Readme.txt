The BRDF based on the parameters proposed by Pugacheva and Shevchenko was added for comparison purposes only. Those parameters are in contraddiction with the parameters obtained from the analysis of the Apollo soil samples proposed by Johnson et.al., resulting, moreover, in a apparently incositent global behaviour of the Moon's disk (brightness becomes strongly dipendent from both the incident and observation angles). Therefore, Hapke-Johnson model is at the moment the most accurate model available for this project. More BRDF models will come hopefully later on.
